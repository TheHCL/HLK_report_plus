# HLK Report Plus

## Why doing this

I work as a Software Application Engineer and one of my jobs is to deal with the windows certification for our Laptop projects.
There's another team working on the application , but the format of the output file is not good enough for us to co-work with our customers.
The team refused to provide the source code of it , even we work for the same company , so I decided to code it myself.


## Features

- Generate a basic report from a HLK/HCK project including results of the test items and the filter information to Excel files.
- Can easily pack the fail items from your project to .HLKP individually
